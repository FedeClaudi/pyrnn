# pyrnn
pythorcn implementation of a vanilla RNN with some useful stuff.

Docomuntation not ready, sorry!

There's an example task, the 3-bit memory task from [this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23272922/)

and I'm working on a fixed points finder like [this](https://github.com/mattgolub/fixed-point-finder)

## Installation
```
pip install pyrnn
```
